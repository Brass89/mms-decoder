# MMS Decoder 0.81

This class was written as a schoolproject by Jonatan Heyman 2003 & 2004.
See the docs/mmsdecoder_api.txt for information on how to use the class.

## Current supports:
 - Almost full header decoding
 - Almost full body decoding

## TODO:
 - Headerfield "Content-type" has parameters that need to be parsed better
 - The header (including the filename) of each part isn't parsed at all. 


Future versions are planned. Fixes and contributions are accepted if I
think they fit. Please fork me :).
